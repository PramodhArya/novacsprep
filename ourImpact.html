        <p>NOVACSPREP hosted a completely free 2-week coding camp of over 80 students from rising 4th to 12 graders. Students of different backgrounds came from various areas around Northern Virginia.  The camp was divided into 3 sections: Scratch (4th-6th grade), Java (7th-9th grade), Python (9th-12th grade). Every section was taught programming at an appropriate pace, and then had a programming competition on the last day. To conclude the camp, a grand award ceremony of over 200 people was held to celebrate the winners of the competitions and much more. In addition, we were extremely honored to have Barbra Comstock, the United States 10th District Congressional Representative of Virginia, come as a special guest and give a speech. She discussed promoting STEM education to everyone by passing legislation and even increasing funding for programs similar to the camp. Also, she handed out Congressional Letters (signed by her) to every student and thanked them for participating. In addition, PTC News aired our entire event on live TV and hosted an interactive, interview afterwards. Overall the camp was a fun experience for every student as they got to have fun and learn at the same time. Thank you very much to Katyayani Sharma for taking pictures at our camp.

Fortunately, through donations from several charities we were able to donate 3,000 dollars to them.</p>
