            <p>Mission Statement</p>
            <p>NOVACSPREP is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding computer science to everyone. Our goal is to give back to the Northern Virginia community by offering every student various opportunities to dive into the world of computer science through interactive programs without financial barriers. Computer Science will only become increasingly important in the future, and it is vital everyone has access to high quality education in it. As a 100% volunteer-run organization, NOVACSPREP aims to create a place for every student at any skill-level to develop and expand his or her computer science knowledge. By providing students with tools to learn, we hope to inspire every student to grow their passion for learning and better the world. Our Philosophy is “Education for Everyone” and we will always stand by it. Every student deserves a fair chance, and we will make sure nothing stops that.</p>
